      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What are progressive reductions?</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body-m">We plan to phase out Direct Payments in England from 2021 to 2027. Our approach is designed to help everyone manage the transition away from Direct Payments as smoothly as possible. The same amount will be available to the farming sector in every year of this Parliament, though the way it is distributed will change. Funds will be redirected straight back into Countryside Stewardship and our new schemes.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body-m">Progressive reductions will be made to Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) payments from the 2021 scheme year, paid from 1 December 2021, and then to delinked payments when these replace BPS. We currently plan to delink payments in 2024. All BPS payments will be reduced from 2021, but there will initially be bigger reductions in higher payment bands. These bands will work like income tax bands.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body-m">We have announced the reductions we intend to apply for each of the years 2021 to 2024. We intend to continue to make gradual reductions to the payments in the later years of the agricultural transition, with the last payments made for the 2027 scheme year.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body-m">For more information about the 2021 to 2024 reductions to Direct Payments, the other support available during the transition period and delinked payments please see 'The Path to Sustainable Farming: An Agricultural Transition Plan 2021 to 2024' and our 'Farming is Changing' leaflet, linked above.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Before you start</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body-m">This calculator will apply progressive reductions to a 'starting payment amount' for the scheme years 2021 to 2024.</p>
      
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">BPS years 2021 to 2023</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body-m">This starting payment amount will be the total payment you would have been due in each scheme year, before progressive reductions are applied. While we operate BPS, the progressive reductions will be applied to the total BPS payment (including any young farmer payment), after all other reductions and penalties have been applied. As now, your BPS payment value will be calculated each year, once financial ceilings for the scheme are set, and will depend on the BPS entitlements and eligible area you claim in that year.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body-m">If, while BPS continues to operate, you expect to claim for a similar area of land as you did in 2020, your 2020 claim value can usually be used as a starting payment amount. If you expect your claim area to change for 2021, you should adjust your starting payment amount accordingly, taking the average unit values from your 2020 Claim Statement and multiplying them by the revised claim area you are planning to use in 2021. There is no limit to the number of times you can use this calculator.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Delinked Payments 2024</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body-m">We currently plan to introduce delinked payments in 2024. For delinked payments, we plan to apply progressive reductions to a 'reference amount', based on the BPS payment you received during a reference period. This may be similar to the value of your current payment. We are consulting on the way in which delinking will work, and more information will be published following that consultation.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">If you have land other than in England or a claim above €150,000</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body-m">This calculator applies for Direct Payments in England. If you also claimed for land in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland in 2020, then you should exclude those parts of your claim from your starting payment amount. If your 2020 claim was above €150,000, you should use your claim value before the 5% reduction was applied to amounts above €150,000. This is because, to avoid overlapping reductions, that 5% reduction no longer applies from the 2021 claim year.</p>
